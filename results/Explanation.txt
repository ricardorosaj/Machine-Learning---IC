As a brief explanation of these sample results:

Code_3 image shows the PCA of all samples analyzed for the samples extracted from the Aorta of patients. This dataset contains 432 samples separated by quartile of the post-mortem time of extraction of the sample from the patient and shows a separation between the quartiles (1,2) from (3,4), 1 and 2 being closer to the time of death and 3 and 4 being further away. This plot was used to select only samples from the first set of quartiles, meaning gene expression from these samples did not suffer alteration from the necroptosis genes expression.

Code_4 image shows the scatter plot of expression of the gene FADD by the time of collection of each sample from the aorta tissue, divided into quartiles. This plot shows the tendency of altering the expression of this gene from the necroptosis pathway as time moves further from the time of death of the patient.

Code_6 image shows the average decision tree generated by the selects in the sql database. The code generates thousands of decision trees and I selected the genes that appeared the most on each tree generated, obtaining a list of genes that are related to each group of disease separated (C, CA, CVD, CVDA).

Finally, there is a presentation of this project from the 29th SIICUSP where this project was presented, explaining in more detail the whole project
